# Bank Customer Churn Prediction & Segmentation 🏦📉

This project focuses on identifying at-risk customers in a banking environment using predictive modeling and behavioral segmentation techniques. It applies RFM analysis, machine learning models, and interactive dashboards to support customer retention strategies.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a churn prediction system and segment customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary behavior, enabling data-driven decisions in customer retention.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, K-Means Clustering
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data**: Cleaned bank churn dataset (customer demographics, product usage, tenure, etc.)

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **Churn Prediction**: Trained logistic regression and decision tree models to identify customers likely to churn with up to 92% accuracy.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Applied RFM scoring and K-Means clustering to group customers by behavior and churn risk level.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful features such as tenure bands, product count indicators, and churn probability scores.
- **Dashboarding**: Built Tableau and Power BI dashboards to visualize churn risk by region, segment, and lifetime value.
